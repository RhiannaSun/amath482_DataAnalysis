# amath482_DataAnalysis
This repository holds projects done for the course AMATH 482: Computational Methods for Data Analysis. Five projects are included; each folder contains a final report and MATLAB code detailing the methods used and results obtained in the project.
- hw1: Noisy ultrasound analysis with Fourier Transform and Gussain Filtering 
- hw2: Sound frequencies analysis with Gabor Transform
- hw3: Capturing useful data from vedio with Singular Value Decomposition and Principle Component Analysis 
- hw4: part(1) Eigenfaces analysis with Singular Value Decompostion on Yale's Eigenfaces dataset 
       part(2) Baisc Machine Learning on the application on music genre classification
- hw5: background subtraction from vedio with Dynamic Mode Decompostion
